Pos Example

	Last Sunday we were able to climb in Pinnacles National Park.  Despite getting extremely cooked in the sun and hearing nothing but complaints about the ‘pinns, we ended up having a really good time.  The rock is famous for these little nubs that look enticing to stand on but pop off sending you and the projectile flying.  I did encounter a few ‘questionable’ pods but otherwise the general rock was sound.  The climbing itself provided a lot of variety from improbable roof cracks that ate protection really well to runout, airy face climbing.
	The area we were at was called the Tourist Trap due to its proximity to the parking lot and the fact that a lot of the casual hikers there will pass you by.  It was pretty funny hearing people freaking out around you when they see you up on the rock.  They were just far enough away to make comments aloud but close enough for us all to hear them.  In hindsight it probably motivated my to try harder moves to put a lot show on for the crowd.
	We did every route at the Tourist Trap and I think they all are really good but I think the top three must do routes are ‘Pick Pocket’ 11b, ‘The 5.9 all the way to the right’, and of course the ultimate classic roof crack ‘Rat Race’ 5.7.  Pick Pocket is very very well protected, it is a very short and awesomely powerful climb.  The moves are big and the feet are hidden, and the whole time it wants to spit you off.  ‘The 5.9’ is really fun with a very difficult and scary opening move to get to the face.  The crux makes it a one move wonder but the views make it worth it to top out.  Lastly ‘Rat Race’ is just 10/10 stunning.  Super solid hand jam after hand jam until a massive overhanging roof with slippery feet.  Some hidden holds help it go at 5.7 but it could easily become more difficult an inexperienced climber.
	Everyone would always tell me that the Pinns aren’t worth it or ‘pure choss’ but this last trip is definitely going to have me come back
