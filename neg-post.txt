Neg Example

I hate “my ucsc”.  The website portal that University California and faculty use as their main administrative portal.  The site itself has some of its own UI problems such as several login forms before the actual login and its (until recently) nonexistent mobile functionality.  Their are of course a couple other issue such as when paying fees, it will tell you the amount owed, and when you go to pay you have to manually enter the amount due.  The problem is the old window is gone that showed you how much you owe so if you didnt memorize the amount you have to go back…wrong if you try going back it resubmits the form and you have to go all the way back to billing.
	The real crime, however, lies in the class search portal.  If the back button functionality in the class search makes the rest of myucsc feel like a dream.   The calendar view does not have its defaults set to the times that classes are offered so you may not see them on your calendar.  On mobile the calendar view cannot fit an entire day let alone the whole week to take a screenshot of the calendar view.
	I think really though the thing that bothers me the most is the fact that myucsc is where I pay my student bills and I blame that site for taking all my money.  Perhaps Im just bitter.  Perhaps the site is fine and enjoyable.  If a horrendous user experience is enjoyable for you.
